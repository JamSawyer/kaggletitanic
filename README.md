# kaggletitanic

In this project, I created a Kaggle workflow in order to help streamline the complex dimensions of my machine learning models as they pertained to the Kaggle competition: Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. By doing so, I was able to identify the strongest model for predicting Titanic survival.
